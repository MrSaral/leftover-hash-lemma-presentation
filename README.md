Introductory presentation on leftover hash lemma, for Stony Brook CSE-590 Cryptography

I took CSE 590 - Cryptography at Stony Brook University for Fall'19.

Under that course, we were required to do a presentation. I had choosen the topic of "leftover hash lemma."

To understand the topic in depth, I used multiple sources, and the references are added at the end of the slides.

Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Omkant and all the researchers in this field.
